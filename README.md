Create: Aquatic Ambitions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a Create Mod Add On that lets you automate prismarine without guardians farms, age your copper faster and revive dead coral.

This mod requires create 5.1.e or newer to work correctly
JEI is reccommended but not required! 


(This may be outdated now. Can you check Davi0? Also is it intended that water blocks cannot be channeled? Only air? If it worked on items underwater, it would be simple to understand. I was not sure how to communicate how it works in the fan icon thing. Check line 9 in en_us.json)

Also, I noticed you still use the default template license. Do you want it like that?
Also, some small improvements that you can choose if you want. Post releases in github, setup an update checker with modmenu (i think), show license on modrinth, make a wiki and make modrinth link to it, setup a cool readme (look at mine, for example) https://github.com/ninjaguardian/Crystallized, check https://github.com/davioliva16/create-aquatic-ambitions/community.
Also setup gradle tasks and worksflows. e.g. Java with Gradle (github), Publish Java Package with Gradle (github), gitleaks (pre-commit and action), gradle versions plugin

Also forge branch and fabric branch have different licenses?????
